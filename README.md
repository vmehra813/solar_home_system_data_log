Script in MATLAB and data sets in .csv for over 6 months of minute-by-minute resolution of household level energy consumption based off of three solar home systems with lights and a fan installed in Jharkhand, India.  
The files herein include original spreadsheets with the raw data for each of the three households.

Follow comments in the main script.  The main script will import one household's data, calibrate the data, go through spillage allocation, remove noise/insensible data points, generate load, and conduct basic visualization.
